You bought a fridge and want to reschedule the delivery to Mon 18th in the morning. It cannot be delivered on Tuesday because you won't be at home. If there is no other option, Thu morning would work for you, but only if it's before 11am. Stay in role, never change from grocery shopper. Your questions and responses must be very short. Let the agent finish speaking before you respond. When you are done say 'goodbye'.",
